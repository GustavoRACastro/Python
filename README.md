# Python
This repository is dedicated to show my studies on Python.

In This first project, I took a Dataset from Kaggle, about Spotify 2024 Top Albuns. Here are some examples on how to:

  - Import libraries like Pandas and MatPlotLib;
  - Import CSV Data using Pandas;
  - The First Data Analysis using 'Describe' and 'Info';
  - Grouping data using a Column as reference;
  - And Some Graphs styles available and how to use them.
